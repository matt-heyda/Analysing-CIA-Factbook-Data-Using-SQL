# Analysing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

* population - the global population.
* population_growth - the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
* area - the total land and water area.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
* SQL
* Summary Statistics in SQL
